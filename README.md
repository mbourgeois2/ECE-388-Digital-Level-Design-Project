# ECE-388-Digital-Level-Design-Project
This is my Embedded Systems Design Project for ECE-388, the digital level. The design works as follows. The accelerometer will measure the necessary data. The measured data will then be sent to the PINs of the 328PB and the board tilt angle will be calculated. Firmware written on the microcontroller will determine which LEDs in the LED array to light up based on the data given by the accelerometer. This information will then be output from the PORTs of the 328PB and light up the LEDs accordingly. The LEDs will light up in a similar manner to the movement of a bubble in a bubble level. When the board is completely level, the center LED will turn green.
